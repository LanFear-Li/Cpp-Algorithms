# Cpp-Algorithms
Learn C++ together with Algorithms !  （：Maybe data structures....

------

In algorithmsClass (based on the book **Introduction to Algorithms**)

- several sort algorithms (bubble sort, count sort, quick sort and heap sort...)
- several structures (stack, queue, heap, linked list...)

In dataStructure

- trees（binary search tree, red-black tree(proposed...)）
- graph algorithms（topologicalSort, SCC...）

In exercise

- bracketExperssion(C++) and bracketExperssion2.0(C) is on my way.
